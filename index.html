            <p>When sea turtles are around 7 to 13 years of age they are able to start mating. Several weeks before nesting season, courtship will occur causing impregnation. After that the turtle will bury her aggs on a shore somewhere. The baby sea turtles then hatch, and are completely on their own from day one.</p>
